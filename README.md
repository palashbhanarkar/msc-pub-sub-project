# Comparative Analysis of Pub/Sub Messaging Systems

## Overview
This project is part of my MSc dissertation and focuses on benchmarking and comparing distributed messaging systems under real-time streaming workloads.

## What I Built
- Cloud-based benchmarking environment
- Performance testing across RabbitMQ, Kafka, and Pulsar
- Custom Python benchmarking scripts
- Monitoring and metrics collection

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Azure VMs / AKS
- RabbitMQ, Kafka, Pulsar
- Datadog
- Azure Monitor

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Understanding of distributed systems
- Performance benchmarking and analysis
- Cloud infrastructure setup
- Observability and monitoring

## Notes
Metrics were collected under controlled test conditions to compare system behavior and scalability.
